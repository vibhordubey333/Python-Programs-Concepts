#### What is Python ?

Python is a: 
  - **Interpreted:** Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP. 
  - **Interactive:** You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.  
  - **Object-oriented:** Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects. 
  - **High-level programming language**
  - Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including Procedural, Object Oriented and Functional programming language. 
  - Python design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
  
#### Is Python pure object oriented ?
Python is an object-oriented language, but it is not a pure object-oriented language.

A pure object-oriented language is one that treats everything as an object and has no primitives or non-object types. However, Python does have some non-object types such as integers, floats, and strings. These types are not objects in the sense that they do not have methods or attributes like objects do. However, Python does allow these types to be treated as objects through a process called boxing, which is automatically done by the interpreter.

Python also supports procedural and functional programming paradigms, in addition to object-oriented programming, which further distinguishes it from a pure object-oriented language. However, Python's object-oriented features are robust and are widely used in many applications.
